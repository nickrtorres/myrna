TODO
----
- Convert AST to DFA
  - Currently, a DFA is a Hashtbl where k = a transition i -> j and v = a
    regular expression for the transition.
    - The simplest way to build the regular expression for the transition is to
      union each edge.
- Feed DFA into kleene's algorithm
- Output RE to STDOUT
  - Multiple backends
    - POSIX (e.g. '?', '|', etc.)
    - Ullman / Kleene
    - more?
- Probably more

Done
----
- Simplify RE computed by kleene's algorithm
  * Only simplifying identities, annihilators, and closure laws atm.

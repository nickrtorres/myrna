- Convert AST to DFA
  - Currently, a DFA is a Hashtbl where k = a transition i -> j and v = a
    regular expression for the transition.
    - The simplest way to build the regular expression for the transition is to
      union each edge.
- Feed DFA into kleene's algorithm
- Simplify RE computed by kleene's algorithm
- Output RE to STDOUT
- Probably more
